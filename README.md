# CSCI3381-Project2
Project 2, create a gui for work in Project 1.
I had to do another workspace since my only idea for a solution to remove a patient was to go into the project 1 source and add a function there since my line of thinking required the data that I couldn't access.
Because of this, when I finally had a working remove patient function in my new workspace, I pushed into this repository and overrid my old commits. Before, there were like 12.
I don't know if this made much sense, but that's why there is just a bunch of data all in one commit.
